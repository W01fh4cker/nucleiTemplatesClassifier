# What  
`nucleiTemplatesClassifier` is a program that filters yaml scripts in nucleii-templates based on year or vulnerability severity.  
# How  
You can download the compiled files directly from https://github.com/W01fh4cker/nucleiTemplatesClassifier/releases.  
You can also compile it yourself directly (my development environment is go 1.21):  
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/W01fh4cker/nucleiTemplatesClassifier.git
cd nucleiTemplatesClassifier
go build
```
# Why
I wrote this tool purely to practice golang and solve some time-consuming tasks in daily life.  

# Other
If you have any good ideas, you can communicate with me at https://github.com/W01fh4cker/nucleiTemplatesClassifier/issues.
